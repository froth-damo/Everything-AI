"Between April and June 2024, the NullBulge group emerged targeting users in AI-centric application and gaming communities. The NullBulge persona has showcased creative methods of distributing malware targeting said tools and platforms. Though the group projects an image of activism claiming to be “protecting artists around the world” and claims to be motivated by a pro-art, anti-AI cause, rather than profit, other activities tied to this threat actor may indicate otherwise. One service the group offers is described as “payback through honeypots and malicious mods.” The group is delivering on this claim by targeting extensions and modifications of commonly used AI-art-adjacent applications and games. This has been their main area of focus recently, delivering a small variety of malware payloads. NullBulge’s attacks are characterized by ‘poisoning the well’: the group targets the software supply chain by injecting malicious code into legitimate software distribution mechanisms, exploiting trusted platforms like GitHub, Reddit and Hugging Face to maximize their reach. NullBulge announces their leaks via their own DLS/blog site, alongside occasional 4chan threads. Further, the group is using customized LockBit ransomware builds to maximize the impact of their attacks. In this post, we provide an overview of the NullBulge group’s malicious activities, and technical details of their LockBit payloads."
